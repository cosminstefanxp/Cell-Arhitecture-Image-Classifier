Cell Arhitecture Image Classifier

The project consists of the implementation of an image classifier on the Cell Arhitecture. There are programs for both the PPU and the SPUs. The output program receives a set of training images (of just 2 types for now), uses LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis) to train and then is able to classify a third set of images.
